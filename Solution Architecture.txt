Follow/unfollow functionality

NestJS Tools/Libraries:
- Passport.js (@nestjs/passport)
- JWT (JSON Web Token) (@nestjs/jwt)
- Bcrypt.js (bcryptjs)
- TypeORM
- NestJS Guards (@nestjs/passport + @nestjs/jwt)

2. Media Management

Key Features:
Upload images and short videos
Image and video processing (compression, format conversion, transcoding)
Cloud storage integration

NestJS Tools/Libraries:
- Multer (@nestjs/platform-express): A middleware for handling file uploads. It can be used to upload images, videos, or any other media files.
- Sharp (sharp): An image processing library that can be used to resize, convert, and optimize images before storing them.
- FFmpeg (fluent-ffmpeg): For video processing, including transcoding and generating thumbnails.
- AWS SDK or Google Cloud Storage (@nestjs/azure-storage, @nestjs/aws-sdk): For cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, ensuring scalability and availability of media files.
- Redis or RabbitMQ: For handling asynchronous jobs related to media processing (video transcoding, image resizing).

3. Post & Feed System

Key Features:
Create, update, and delete posts
Like, comment, and share posts
Personalized feed generation

NestJS Tools/Libraries:
- TypeORM/Sequelize: For persisting posts, likes, and comments in the database. You can use TypeORM with PostgreSQL to model entities like Post, Like, Comment.
- Redis (ioredis): Can be used to manage user feeds and cache results for faster delivery of personalized content (e.g., cache most recent posts).
- Elasticsearch (@nestjs/elasticsearch): For fast searching and filtering of posts based on keywords, hashtags, or user mentions.
- GraphQL (@nestjs/graphql): To implement a flexible API for querying posts, likes, comments, and feed generation. This can be useful if you want to provide a custom, highly optimized querying mechanism for your frontend.

4. Search & Discovery

Key Features:
Search for users and posts
Explore trending posts and users
Suggestions for following

NestJS Tools/Libraries:
- Elasticsearch (@nestjs/elasticsearch): Can be used for full-text search capabilities and advanced queries like searching by hashtag, user, or location. Elasticsearch is ideal for scalability in search and discovery features.
- TypeORM/Sequelize: For managing relational data like users and posts and providing indexing for quick searching.
- Redis (ioredis): To store trending posts or users temporarily to improve discovery speed.

5. Notifications

Key Features:
Real-time push notifications
In-app notifications
NestJS Tools/Libraries:

- Socket.io (@nestjs/websockets): For real-time communication and sending in-app notifications (like likes, comments, or follows) to users.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) (firebase-admin): For push notifications. FCM is a great service for sending notifications to Android and iOS devices.
- Bull (@nestjs/bull): For background jobs to handle sending notifications asynchronously, such as when multiple notifications need to be delivered in bulk.

6. Messaging

Key Features:
Direct messaging between users
Typing indicators and read receipts
NestJS Tools/Libraries:

Socket.io (@nestjs/websockets): For real-time chat functionality, including typing indicators and message delivery confirmation.
Redis (ioredis): Can be used for storing and synchronizing chat messages in real time across different instances of the application.
MongoDB (@nestjs/mongoose): For storing messages in a NoSQL database. Itâ€™s often more scalable for real-time messaging because of its flexible schema and fast reads/writes.
Bull (@nestjs/bull): For handling background jobs related to messages, like sending notifications or updating read receipts.

7. Analytics & Monitoring

Key Features:
Track user engagement (views, likes, comments)
Collect system performance metrics

NestJS Tools/Libraries:
- Prometheus (prom-client): For collecting and monitoring application metrics such as request latency, error rates, and throughput.
- Grafana: Can be integrated with Prometheus for visualizing performance metrics.
- Winston or Pino (winston, pino): Logging libraries for centralized logging, which can be integrated with external systems like Elasticsearch for error tracking and monitoring.
- NestJS Logger: The built-in logging module for general application logging needs.

8. API Gateway

Key Features:
Single entry point for all external requests

NestJS Tools/Libraries:
- GraphQL (@nestjs/graphql): If you are using GraphQL for flexible and efficient querying across multiple microservices.
- API Gateway (@nestjs/microservices): For creating an API Gateway that forwards requests to the appropriate microservices, using patterns like REST or gRPC.

9. Authentication Service

Key Features:
JWT-based or OAuth2-based authentication

NestJS Tools/Libraries:
- Passport.js (@nestjs/passport): To integrate multiple authentication strategies like JWT, OAuth2, and third-party providers.
- JWT (@nestjs/jwt): To issue and validate JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
- OAuth2: OAuth2 libraries can be used if you need integration with Google, Facebook, or other external authentication providers.
